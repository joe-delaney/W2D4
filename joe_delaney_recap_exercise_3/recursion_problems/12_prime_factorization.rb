# The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive 
# integer is either a prime or can be represented as a product of 
# prime numbers.

# Write a method prime_factorization(num) that accepts a number and 
# returns an array representing the prime factorization of the given 
# number. This means that the array should contain only prime numbers 
# that multiply together to the given num. The array returned should 
# contain numbers in ascending order. Do this recursively.

def prime_factorization(num)
    (2...num).each do |factor|
        if num % factor == 0
            counterpart = num / factor 
            return [*prime_factorization(factor), *prime_factorization(counterpart)]
        end
    end
    [num]
end

# Examples
p prime_factorization(12)     # => [2, 2, 3]
p prime_factorization(24)     # => [2, 2, 2, 3]
p prime_factorization(25)     # => [5, 5]
p prime_factorization(60)     # => [2, 2, 3, 5]
p prime_factorization(7)      # => [7]
p prime_factorization(11)     # => [11]
p prime_factorization(2017)   # => [2017]
